title: About me
---

I am a security researcher working at **Mozilla** in Paris and previously
graduated with a PhD from **Inria** and **École Normale Supérieure**.

My research is focused on using **formal methods to implement cryptographic
primitives and to design security & privacy protocols**.

I currently work on multiple projects at Mozilla such as MLS and Privacy Pass.
I am the module owner for
([NSS](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/build.html#mozilla-projects-nss-building)),
the Cryptographic and TLS library used in Firefox and many other products.  NSS
also contains the implementation of the Mozilla Root Store which is managed by my
colleagues within the Security and Privacy Engineering team.

I am also a co-author of the
[HACL\*](https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star) formally verified
cryptographic library, which is used in many places such as Windows or the Linux
Kernel...

Working on Internet Standards at the Internet Engineering Task Force
([IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)) is also an important part of my work. I help
standardizing security and privacy protocols such as
[TLS 1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tls/about/) and
[MLS 1.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/).
