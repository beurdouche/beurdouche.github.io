title: About me
---

I am a security researcher working at **Mozilla** in Paris and previously
graduated with a PhD from **Inria** and **École Normale Supérieure**.

My primary role these days is to lead strategic initiatives related to
Firefox Enterprise while, in the background, my research is focused on
using **formal methods to implement cryptographic primitives and to
design and analyze security & privacy protocols**.

In addition, I currently lead multiple other projects at Mozilla such as
Messaging Layer Security (MLS), Web Application Integrity Consistency
Transparency (WAICT), Secure Storage, and our cryptographic and TLS library (NSS).

Working on Internet Standards at the Internet Engineering Task Force
([IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)) is also an important part of my work. I help
standardizing security and privacy protocols such as
[TLS 1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tls/about/) and
[MLS 1.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/).

Outside work, I am one of the members of the European Commission's
Expert Group on a roadmap on Encryption.

I am also a co-author of the
[HACL\*](https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star) formally verified
cryptographic library, which is used in many places such as Windows or the Linux
Kernel...
