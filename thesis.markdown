The title of my thesis is: **“Formal Verification for High Assurance Security Software in F*”**.\
The [thesis manuscript]({{ site.url }}/assets/thesis-beurdouche.pdf).
The [slides of the defense]({{ site.url }}/publications/2020-Thesis-Slides.pdf).

The defense focused on how to build formally verified C artifacts
such as a cryptographic library ([HACL\*](https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star)),
scale the approach to protocol libraries (TLS, Signal\*) and how to use this experience
to design and prove secure new protocols such as Messaging Layer Security ([MLS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about)).
